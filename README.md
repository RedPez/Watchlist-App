## About the project

Welcome to The Watchlist application!

Watchlist is a user-friendly app designed to enhance your TV viewing experience by putting the power of ratings and reviews in your hands.

With access to a vast database of TV shows, users can easily search for their favorite shows using the search bar. Once found, they have the option to rate the show based on various criteria such as plot, characters, pace and more, as well as giving the show an overall rating. Additionally, users can add shows to their watchlist for easy access later on.

Whether you're a casual viewer looking for your next binge-worthy series or a TV enthusiast eager to share your thoughts, Watchlist is here to make your TV watching experience even more enjoyable.

Happy rating!
